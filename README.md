# UK CRIME ANALYSIS

Using time series data, this analysis will look at the trend of violent crimes using data provided by the UK police department and determine whether there are other causes of gun-related crimes besides the traditional gang culture and the locations with more gun-related crimes. My jupyter notebook also has a detailed comment on each cell and markdowns for more explanation. 

## The Technical Approach Used Will Entail The Following;

1. Hosting the data on Azure blob storage to speed up computational time.
2. Utilising Apache Spark for handling large volumes of data.
3. Filtering the data sets to get only relevant information.
4. Visualizing outcomes in a very clear and understandable format.
5. Using statistical and machine learning techniques to ascertain facts and make possible predictions.
