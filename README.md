# UK CRIME ANALYSIS

The number of young males involved in deadly gun-related violence in the UK has increased in recent years. There hasn't been a clear justification for why this is taking place. Some have linked this violence to a growing "gun culture," while others blame the suspected entry of American-style gangs into UK streets.
This analysis will look at additional causes of firearm crimes using data already provided by the UK police department to predict the future trend of violent crimes and determine whether there are other causes of gun-related crimes besides the traditional gang culture and the locations with more gun-related crimes.

## The Technical Approach Used Will Entail The Following;

1. Hosting the data on Azure blob storage to speed up computational time.
2. Utilising Apache Spark for handling large volumes of data.
3. Filtering the data sets to get only relevant information.
4. Visualizing outcomes in a very clear and understandable format.
5. Using statistical and machine learning techniques to ascertain facts and make possible predictions.
